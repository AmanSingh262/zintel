# IMPORTANT: This is a Next.js/Node.js project
# This file should NOT be used for building the main application
# 
# Python backends are in subdirectories with their own requirements:
# - llm model/requirements.txt (LLM backend service)
# - budget_pipeline/requirements.txt (data pipeline)
#
# If Render is reading this file, the build detection is incorrect.
# The main app uses package.json for Node.js dependencies.

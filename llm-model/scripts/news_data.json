Since then, King has remained one of the most talked-about upcoming Bollywood projects, with anticipation steadily building around its scale, cast, and genre.</p><p>One of the biggest highlights of King is that it marks the theatrical debut of Suhana Khan. The film will see her sharing screen space with her father, Shah Rukh Khan, for the first time, making it a significant milestone for both. The father-daughter collaboration has added an emotional and celebratory dimension to the film\u2019s release.</p><p>Directed by Siddharth Anand, King is mounted as a stylised action thriller and is produced by Gauri Khan, Siddharth Anand, and Mamta Anand under the banners of Red Chillies Entertainment and Marflix Pictures.

An exclusive report by Variety India recently claimed that the Ranveer Singh\u2013Akshaye Khanna starrer had cracked a massive music deal worth Rs. 50\u201360 crore with music giant T-Series, calling it one of the costliest music rights acquisitions in the history of Hindi cinema. However, Bollywood Hungama has independently fact-checked the claim and found the reported figures to be significantly inflated.</p><p></p><p>According to a well-placed industry source close to T-Series, the actual amount paid for the music rights of Dhurandhar: The Revenge stands at Rs. 27 crores, nearly half of what has been widely reported. The deal, the source confirms, covers four languages \u2014 Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada, making it a comprehensive multi-lingual acquisition rather than a single-language music rights purchase. \u201cThe numbers doing the rounds are exaggerated,\u201d the source told Bollywood Hungama. \u201cThe Variety report is inaccurate and demonstrates their weak grasp of the current dynamics of Bollywood music rights. It fails to factor in how multi-language deals are structured, bundled, and valued today. The real figure is Rs. 27 crores. It is still a very strong deal by industry standards, especially considering the evolving economics of music monetisation.\u201d</p><p>While the corrected figure may not match the astronomical numbers initially reported, the deal remains a significant milestone for the franchise. For context, the first Dhurandhar had fetched Rs. 15 crores for its music rights. The sequel has almost doubled that value, underlining the franchise\u2019s sharp rise in commercial credibility following the success of the first film.</p><p>Industry insiders point out that multi-language music rights are increasingly being bundled into a single deal, particularly for big-ticket pan-Indian films. This often creates confusion when headline figures are floated without clarity on language scope, revenue-sharing models, or backend clauses.</p><p>What remains undisputed is that Dhurandhar: The Revenge has become one of the most valuable music acquisitions of the year, reinforcing the film\u2019s strong pre-release buzz and the continued dominance of T-Series in the music rights market.

This will also be his second consecutive turn as an antagonist, following his role in Priyadarshan\u2019s Haiwaan, where he starred opposite Saif Ali Khan.</p><p>Ajay Devgn continues to anchor the Golmaal ensemble, leading a familiar group of actors. Regular cast members such as Arshad Warsi, Tusshar Kapoor, Shreyas Talpade and Kunal Kemmu are expected to return, along with veteran comedians Johnny Lever, Sanjay Mishra, Mukesh Tiwari and Ashwini Kalsekar. There is also speculation that Sharman Joshi may reprise his role, though Kareena Kapoor Khan\u2019s participation has not yet been confirmed.</p><p>Production for Golmaal 5 is scheduled to begin by the end of February 2026 at Film City in Mumbai, with a target theatrical release in early 2027. The film arrives as the franchise celebrates two decades since its inception, and it will mark the sixth collaboration between Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn, following projects such as Suhaag (1994), Khakee (2004), Insan (2005), Sooryavanshi (2021) and Singham Again (2024).</p><p>At the time of the report, the makers had not officially confirmed Akshay Kumar\u2019s casting, leaving some details subject to formal announcements.</p><p>Also Read:\u00a0Akshay Kumar calls Rani Mukerji \u201cGoddeess of acting\u201d as he reviews Mardaani 3: \u201cI saw it.

In an exclusive conversation with Bollywood Hungama, producer Bhushan Kumar and director Anurag Singh opened up about the logistical, technical and creative challenges involved in mounting large-scale war scenes without relying on green screens.</p><p></p><p>Director Anurag Singh revealed that one of the biggest challenges was shooting the action entirely on real locations rather than in controlled studio environments. The film was shot across locations such as Dehradun and Jhansi, often in extreme weather conditions, with large crews and complex staging.</p><p>He explained, \u201cShoot-wise, the most challenging were the action sequences. Because the scale increases. Your three\u2013four-person crew becomes a 400\u2013500-person unit sitting there. Because the scale increases. You are shooting on actual locations, not on green screen \u2013 in places like Dehradun or Jhansi. There is freezing cold or unbearable heat, and you have to do action from morning till evening.\u201d</p><p>According to Singh, war sequences demand a level of coordination that goes far beyond standard action choreography. Each shot involves multiple departments working in sync \u2014 from explosives and stunts to crowd movement and actor positioning \u2014 leaving little margin for error.</p><p>\u201cThere are many elements in action. So many things have to come together. It has to work like clockwork for one shot to land correctly. You are doing blasts; you have to place explosives. How will people react, which actor will be at what distance, how much fire will come out \u2013 you know, all these people are working together to\u2026 And it is war. It\u2019s not just two people\u2019s action; behind them, 500 more people are running around, firing is going on, all this is happening. So doing action at that scale was quite difficult,\u201d he added.</p><p>Another significant challenge was handling elements that cannot be practically recreated, particularly aerial combat. Singh noted that while the film aimed for realism, certain components, such as fighter planes, had to be created using visual effects \u2014 requiring careful integration to maintain believability.</p><p>\u201cThe second tricky part was that some things are not available today. If you talk about planes, the planes will obviously be VFX. You know, it\u2019s not like you have actual planes with you that you can fly and shoot, so that has to be VFX.
